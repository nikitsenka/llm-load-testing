One day, while plundering a distant island, he stumbled upon an old treasure map. Excited by the prospect of buried gold, Baron gathered his crew and set sail for the hidden location.\n\nAfter weeks at sea, they finally arrived at the island and began their search. They dug and searched high and low, but to their dismay, they couldn't find a thing. Just as they were about to give up, an old crone appeared from the forest. She cackled and said, \"Ahoy, Matey Baron! The treasure you seek is not gold, but wisdom!\"\n\nBaron, confused and disappointed, grumbled, \"Wisdom? What good is that compared to gold?\"\n\nThe old woman replied, \"It may not be shiny or valuable in the eyes of man, but it will enrich your mind and make you a true treasure.\"\n\nWith a heavy heart, Baron and his crew decided to return home. But as they sailed away from the island, a strange feeling of contentment filled them. They had learned that sometimes, the most valuable treasures are the ones we least expect. And so, Baron lived out the rest of his days as a wise and respected pirate captain, always eager to share the wisdom he had gained on that distant island.","done":true,"context":[733,16289,28793,28705,22031,264,633,2485,13015,354,2477,28705,28782,28725,28750,28734,28725,28782,28734,1267,1571,1683,442,2525,28723,12860,653,378,354,624,302,272,9206,2955,28747,5013,28725,28705,28740,28750,28770,28781,28725,20575,952,28740,28725,802,28776,28808,28725,28142,28725,365,1087,832,28723,3782,390,624,302,272,9206,22962,28747,3140,28725,3057,28725,17368,380,28725,281,9754,28725,6569,4385,733,28748,16289,28793,6441,28708,28747,19346,380,325,28760,1087,832,28731,13,13,16114,3714,264,727,28725,736,403,264,22257,304,277,13860,17368,380,5160,23152,28723,2387,1370,28725,1312,549,915,2131,264,15569,8919,28725,400,27907,3714,396,1571,25496,3341,28723,1529,28717,1345,486,272,11450,302,14228,5014,28725,23152,13398,516,9505,304,808,12432,354,272,7918,4723,28723,13,13,9169,4587,438,6163,28725,590,4251,6792,438,272,8919,304,3125,652,3472,28723,1306,21616,304,22671,1486,304,2859,28725,562,298,652,704,12001,28725,590,3481,28742,28707,1300,264,1970,28723,3194,390,590,654,684,298,2111,582,28725,396,1571,1439,538,6178,477,272,8613,28723,985,277,468,1006,304,773,28725,345,17114,904,28725,351,380,28724,23152,28808,415,25496,368,5695,349,459,5014,28725,562,16679,2781,13,13,28760,5214,28725,13803,304,18913,28725,847,12802,28725,345,28780,278,2920,28804,1824,1179,349,369,6731,298,5014,1110,13,13,1014,1571,2971,8558,28725,345,1313,993,459,347,27348,442,12302,297,272,2282,302,676,28725,562,378,622,481,6408,574,2273,304,1038,368,264,1132,25496,611,13,13,2946,264,5917,3031,28725,23152,304,516,9505,4496,298,604,1611,28723,1092,390,590,268,2384,1753,477,272,8919,28725,264,8708,4622,302,3036,466,6774,706,28723,1306,553,5996,369,4662,28725,272,1080,12302,2655,20139,460,272,4413,478,2429,1675,28723,1015,579,28725,23152,6262,575,272,1846,302,516,2202,390,264,16446,304,23425,17368,380,13565,28725,1743,15381,298,4098,272,16679,400,553,14018,356,369,15569,8919,28723],"total_duration":8906976750,"load_duration":629958,"prompt_eval_duration":28930000,"eval_count":304,"eval_duration":8876730000}
